Flask-Weirds
====================

Flask Framework (see http://flask.pocoo.org/) extension to create
web-application servers to provide WEIRDS services.

* http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/weirds/

This extension is currently in development and does not pretend to be a
complete implementation of current state of proposals that IETF working
group is discussing.

Typical use similar to the following sudo-code:

    class ObjectModel(flask.ext.weirds.WeirdsDataModel):
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = find_magic_object(name)
        
        def public_data(self):
            return { 'name' : self.name}
    
    app = flask.ext.weirds.FlaskWeirdsApp(__name__)
    
    @app.route('/object/<name>')
    def object(name):
      return ObjectModel(name),



Example
--------------------

You may find bits of code similar to concepts above in the example
provided with this package "weirdsexample.py". You may create your own
WEIRDS service copying an example and adding new "data producing" code.

To run example (or your own service) you may:

* execute python script as is and use  http://localhost:5000/
  as base URI of your service (bind address 0.0.0.0:5000 is currently
  hard-coded in script)
* use WSGI application container, such as uwsgi:
  uwsgi -w weirdsexample --callable app --http 0.0.0.0:5000
  this would allow you to control more web-application runtime
  parameters

To run SSL-protected service you may use front-end Web server, either
Apache or Nginx is a simpliest choice. You may consider switching the
app to use fastcgi or uwsgi communication with frontend.


Installation
--------------------

It's not quite recommended to install this library because it's likely
going thru lots of changes. Example is designed in a way to use current
directory to be added to python's module search path and can be run as
is. You may, however, use setup.py.risk to install flask_weirds module.
