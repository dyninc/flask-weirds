Flask-Weirds
====================

Flask Framework (see http://flask.pocoo.org/) extension to create web-application
servers to provide WEIRDS services.

* http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/weirds/

This extension is currently in development and does not pretend to be a complete
implementation of current state of proposals that IETF working group is discussing.

Typical use similar to the following sudo-code:

    class ObjectModel(flask.ext.weirds.WeirdsDataModel):
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = find_magic_object(name)
        
        def public_data(self):
            return { 'name' : self.name}
    
    app = flask.ext.weirds.FlaskWeirdsApp(__name__)
    
    @app.route('/object/<name>')
    def object(name):
      return ObjectModel(name),


You may find similar bits of code in example, provided with this package,
weirdsexample.py.
